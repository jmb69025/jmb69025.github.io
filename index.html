<h1><BIG><CENTER><u>The Early Days</u></CENTER></BIG></h1> 
<p>My name is Jack Bickford and I am a sophomore at The University of Georgia. I have played sports my whole life, starting at age 6 with my first round of golf. My dad introduced me to golf at a very young age because he has played golf all of his life. I was extremely interested in golf up until about eighth grade. I was on my middle school golf team and played in multiple tournaments as a kid. However, when I moved to Maryland in eighth grade everything changed. I had heard of lacrosse and was interested in it but had never played. I signed up for a recreational league to make friends, and as they say the rest is history. My first game went horribly, I couldn't catch or throw but it didn't matter, I was hooked. Ever since that game, I have been obsessed with lacrosse and have played or thought about the game everyday since.</p>

<h2> <STRONG><CENTER><u>High School Lacrosse</u></CENTER></STRONG></h2>
<p>By the time I was in High School I had played enough lacrosse to the point where I was a competitive player. I decided to try out for the varsity team my freshman year instead of the junior varsity team. To my amazement, I was one of only three freshman to make the varsity team. That being said, I rarely got any playing time my Freshman year. I would only play sometimes in the second half when my team was winning by a lot. My sophomore year was the start of me actually contributing to the team. I was awarded a starting spot my sophomore year, which made being on the team a lot more fun. Junior and Senior year are where most of my favorite lacrosse memories come from. Although, we never made it further than the Regional Semifinals, I had the most fun playing Junior and Senior years because I was considered a leader on the team and contributed on the field more than ever before.  </p>

<h4><BIG><CENTER><u>My Involvement with Lacrosse in College</u></CENTER></BIG></h4> 
<p>When I first arrived at college, I was planning on playing on the Club Lacrosse Team here. However, once I discovered the practice and game schedule for the club team, which is practice three nights a week and games on saturday all year, I decided against the club team. However, I still wanted to be involved in lacrosse so my friend and I tried to start an intramural lacrosse league with games on most weekends. We contacted the head of intramural sports and we were told that they didn't have enough funding to establish lacrosse. So, my involvement with lacrosse is fairly limited nowadays. I have a goal and some sticks at my house here in Athens, so I try to play as often as I can. I also try to watch all of the lacrosse I can on television. I really do miss playing for and being involved with a lacrosse team. However, circumstances sadly don;t permit me to do so in college. As for the future, I hope to play in a leisurely mens league or coach a youth team. Lacrosse is very important to me and I hope to be involved for the rest of my life. </p>
